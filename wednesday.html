  <h1>Wednesday</h1>
  <p>
    Wednesday is the midpoint of the week — often called "hump day." It's a great time to reflect on what you've accomplished so far and adjust your plans for the rest of the week. Whether you're powering through tasks or taking a moment to recharge, Wednesday offers a chance to balance productivity and self-care.
